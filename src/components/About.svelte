  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hey there! I go by Nick747, but feel free to call me Mario. I&apos;m a teen
    based in Italy who enjoys developing with website and mobile app development
    for fun. I&apos;ve experience in vanilla <Language language="HTML" />, <Language language="CSS"/>, 
    and <Language language="JavaScript" />, and these days, I&apos;m
    exploring tools like <Language language="React" />, <Language language="Svelte" />, 
    <Language language="TailwindCSS" />, and <Language language="Astro" />.
    My passion lies in crafting mobile apps using <Language language="Flutter" /> & 
    <Language language="Dart" />. While I&apos;m still getting the hang of it, 
    I also have some basic familiarity with languages like <Language language="C" />/<Language language="CPP" />,
     <Language language="Python" /> and <Language language="Kotlin" />. 
     When it comes to coding, I&apos;m all about <Language language="VSCode" />, 
     though I switch over to <Language language="NeoVim" /> on my Linux machine. 
     Outside of school, I spend my free time playing around with designs for websites,
    apps, or just about any service that sparks my interest. Looking ahead, I&apos;m
    planning to attend university and pursue a career in the industry, maybe even
    start my own company someday! Also, in case you&apos;re wondering, I&apos;m fluent
    in Italian (it&apos;s my native language), I&apos;m fairly proficient in English
    (B2), and I&apos;m currently diving into learning Russian.
