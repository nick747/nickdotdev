  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Hey there! I go by Nick747, but feel free to call me Mario. I&apos;m a teen
    based in Italy who enjoys developing with website and mobile app development
    for fun. I&apos;ve experience in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and
    these days, I&apos;m exploring tools like React, Svelte, TailwindCSS, and
    Astro. My passion lies in crafting mobile apps using Flutter & Dart. While
    I&apos;m still getting the hang of it, I also have some basic familiarity
    with languages like C/C++, Python and Kotlin. When it comes to coding,
    I&apos;m all about VS Code, though I switch over to Neovim on my Linux
    machine. Outside of school, I spend my free time playing around with designs
    for websites, apps, or just about any service that sparks my interest.
    Looking ahead, I&apos;m planning to attend university and pursue a career in
    the industry, maybe even start my own company someday! Also, in case
    you&apos;re wondering, I&apos;m fluent in Italian (it&apos;s my native
    language), I&apos;m fairly proficient in English (B2), and
    I&apos;m currently diving into learning Russian.
